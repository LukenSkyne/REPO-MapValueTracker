## About

It is based on the original [MapValueTracker](https://thunderstore.io/c/repo/p/Tansinator/Map_Value_Tracker/) by Tansinator, allowing players to see the number of items and total value outside the extract zone.  
By default, as soon as the last extract's goal is met, it also shows how far to the closest valuable you are (meant to be used together with [ExtractionPointConfirmButton](https://thunderstore.io/c/repo/p/Zehs/ExtractionPointConfirmButton/).

## Features

* Show total value
* Show item count
* Show the closest item's distance (rough distance or precise)

## Acknowledgements

* [Tansinator](https://github.com/tansinator) for the original project
